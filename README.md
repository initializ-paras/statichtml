# Personal Blog Website

My Personal Blogging Website for 2023

Started December 2022, and will be updated with my blogs!

<hr>

 I created this site using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and originally using the [PaperMod theme](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod). 

 The site is deployed using Netlify free hosting for static websites.
