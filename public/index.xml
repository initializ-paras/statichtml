      <description>Over two years ago, back in 2020, I decided to &amp;ldquo;skip&amp;rdquo; grade 12. Here were the reasons that I listed back then (Mar. 2021), unchanged from the moment I wrote them.
The Reasons You get an extra year of your life working or learning compared to a regular student. Benefits your wealth, your experiences, etc. COVID should be gone by fall, but who knows what will happen next year? You boost your morale because it seems like you accomplished something great or made yourself special You don&amp;rsquo;t have to go to prom, grad photo-ops with some people you hardly know Universities may like your application more since you graduated early.</description>

      <description>The Hart House Holidays Open hosted by the historic Hart House Chess Club (HHCC) returned for the first time since the pandemic. This holiday season tradition had been sidelined since Dec. 2019 thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic and the gathering restrictions stemmed from it. I had the privilege (or responsibility as a HHCC Exec) of joining the tournament organizing team as one of the lead organizers for the event.
The Event Recap 212 participants descended on the Great Hall of Hart House at the University of Toronto from Dec.</description>

      <title>Why We Started Hack Team 6</title>

      <description>You may have noticed the lack of hackathons from our global rounds this past year. And you’d be right. We’ve been working hard on a new program called Hack Team 6. The mission? – train high-school students&amp;rsquo; event planning skills online, efficiently, and in a manner that is fun.
Joining XdHacks Mini in 2020, the landscape was different than today. XdHacks Mini was the only high-school hackathon organization in British Columbia (where I’m from), Zoom was still relatively new, and people were still comfortable with online events and online hackathons.</description>

      <description>On the morning of June 21st, 2022, I woke up to a text message to our Club&amp;rsquo;s account from aa random stranger. It said something along the lines of how they needed chess sets for an important chess event happening in Downtown Toronto that afternoon, and that we were one of the only Clubs in Toronto that they thought would be able to help. I quickly responded by saying that we&amp;rsquo;re not open and that we don&amp;rsquo;t usually offer chess equipment for such a last minute request.</description>

      <description>The International Science and Engineer Fair is one of the most famous science fairs in the world, where over 1500+ students come together to showcase their research and innovative skills and compete for over $6,000,000 in prizes. XdHacks Mini was invited to organize a mini-hackathon for this event, in-person, in Atlanta, Georgia. This is my experience.
0. It all first started when Kaden, our President got an email from the Society for Science about hosting a hackathon at ISEF.</description>
