The [International Science and Engineer Fair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Science_and_Engineering_Fair) is one of the most famous science fairs in the world, where over 1500+ students come together to showcase their research and innovative skills and compete for over $6,000,000 in prizes. XdHacks Mini was invited to organize a mini-hackathon for this event, in-person, in Atlanta, Georgia. This is my experience.

It all first started when Kaden, our President got an email from the Society for Science about hosting a hackathon at ISEF. How they got to us? - by typing in the worlds Mini-Hackathon and Climate to Google. Luckily for us, our website is hosted on mini.xdhacks, which fits the "mini" bill, and the event that I directed, Climate Code 2021, was also there. Thus, we began negotiating on running an event at this upcoming fair.

After months of dedicated work and communicating with one another on how the event would run and operate, we headed down to Atlanta for this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Since the ISEF fair rotates every year, we were lucky enough to be able to head to Atlanta, a city that I had never visited before.

As I had just finished my exams, the flight down was nice and Delta really showed why it was rated so highly. The Atlanta airport also showed me why it was the busiest airport in North America with an internal train between something like 7 terminals!

Since we arrived on day 3 of the event, the activities were already underway and events progressing smoothly. I really wanted to make the most of my experience, so I made sure to tune out everything that I wouldn't ever be able to experience elsewhere. I went to all the big attractions, checked out all the student exhibits, and interacted with most, if not all the students. Unsurprisingly, a lot of the participants thought I was a participant as well - I was only 17 and most of the other participants were also my age. This made it interesting when we first checked in, as I had to explain that I was actually an organizer of the event!
