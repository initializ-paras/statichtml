On February 26th, the cumulation of over a year of planning resulted in the first ever Canadian University Tennis Club Championship at the University of Waterloo. This is my report from organizing and directing the event. 

Firstly, for context, I am the President of the University of Toronto Tennis Club, a Club with 145 paid members and an overall impact of ~800 students annually. This was one of my dreams ever since joining the Club and I'm really happy to be writing this post on the successful event that it was.

## The Beginning
Entering University of Toronto in 2021, I really didn't know what I wanted to do. However, I knew that I loved two things: chess and tennis. Therefore, I decided that it'd be smart to join the two Clubs that the campus community was a part of. However, I realized soon after joining both Clubs that there was something missing. And instead of complaining to others and dwindling, I decided that I could use my skills to create the change that I wish to see. 

Because of a lack of weekly tennis offered by the UofT Tennis Club (UTTC), I applied for the role of Court Coordinator. What I found was that nobody wanted the role and that I was essentially immediately promoted to Director of Courts / Head of Court Practices. In my first year at the Club, I focused on running outdoor tennis at Ramsden Park and then thereafter at Cedarvale Park. However, turnout was always between 3 - 10 people, nothing ever big. And soon thereafter, an early snowfall season and cold forced us to stop operating our weekly practices. As the Head of Courts in just my 2nd year of University, I didn't have any experience with coordinating booking nor signing contracts for indoor courts. Therefore, our Vice-President was in charge of this and contacted a bunch of indoor facilities in November, to no avail. We then went into the new year with a month-long pandemic induced break (UofT was closed) and I really felt that our Club wasn't doing anything. Then, I decided to take it to my own hands. 

As an aside: UofT's main campus, UTSG, doesn't have their own indoor tennis facilities other than at a multi-purpose gym that allows for drop-ins and intramurals in the mornings which get booked instantly. 

I decided to send emails to Tennis Canada, UofT's Athletics Centre, and local indoor tennis clubs asking about indoor tennis opportunities. I compiled documents on all the ~7 local indoor tennis centres and the contacts of their managers. I also compiled contacts for various clubs across Ontario in the hopes that I could learn from them and what they did to get court hours. In my communication with these other universities, I offered to collaborate with them in the future on events to revive the University tennis landscape in Canada. That's also when we heard back from Eglinton Flats. 

Flash forward 1 year later, and I'm now the President of the Club and we're off to Waterloo! The event was held this year in Waterloo because it was the closest of the three participating clubs: Western, Waterloo, and UofT (us). 

We had booked courts at Greystone Racquet Club, a recently opened, state of the art, 6-court facility next to the Waterloo campus. The nice thing about this tennis tournament was that we didn't have to organize anything until relatively last minute. The format was basically set, and the main problem was attracting enough people to go. 

Essentially, our Executive sent out a form to our members asking who wanted to play for our Club. There was a lot of interest, so I used a variety of factors to select a team based on performances at the UofT Tennis Club championship and commitment to the Club's indoor/outdoor tennis season. Perhaps we could've ran a selection tournament, but we really didn't have many indoor courts available just to do that. The women's side was the trickiest as we had to recruit 4 women, and we only had about 5 interested in going. Hymn, one of the Director of Courts, helped me reach out to the people she knew, and we finally assembled our team. 

I ordered a trophy from a local shop and Takeshi helped pick it up for me. He also would serve as our official photographer (credit to him for the photos). Then, we were off. In our budget, we originally didn't budget for a car rental, but learning about how unconvenient it would be, I decided to allow that to be added as a misc cost. Wenda and Khang would be our drivers, and we headed out bright and early. We arrived at 11:40 pm, and we got everyone onto the courts practicing. 

As part of our plans, the 12pm - 1pm period would involve the Captain's meeting and debrief on the logistics of the event. I had made sure to bring enough boys that I didn't have to compete and I could help coach/watch our players. This allowed me to serve as the Team Captain and also Tournament Director for the tournament.  

As a freshman entering UofT in 2021, I never thought that I would be in the position I am today, as the leader and representative of over 145 members of the University of Toronto Tennis Club. I point to a lot of hard work, dedication, and commitment as the reasons for where I am today in this role. As we begin our 2023 election cycle, I urge all candidates to join our Executive and make the change that you wish to see.
